K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier for Semeion Dataset
====================

Digit Classifier using K-Nearest Neighbors

Dataset used : Semeion Dataset from collection of UCI repositories, found @ http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Semeion+Handwritten+Digit

Current Implementation uses 5-nearest neighbors

Objectives:
1. Learning basic sklearn features like spliting training and test data from the dataset
2. Visualizing data in 2-D by reducing the dimensions using PCA, with 2 components
3. Running knn built in sklearn
4. Using confution matrix for classifier evaluation
5. Using pandas with pyplot for easy data processing
