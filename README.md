K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier for Semeion Dataset
-------------------------------------------------

Digit Classifier using K-Nearest Neighbors

Dataset used : Semeion Dataset from collection of UCI repositories, found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Semeion+Handwritten+Digit

Current Implementation uses 5-nearest neighbors

Objectives:
* Learning basic sklearn features like spliting training and test data from the dataset
* Visualizing data in 2-D by reducing the dimensions using PCA, with 2 components
* Running knn built in sklearn
* Using confution matrix for classifier evaluation
* Using pandas with pyplot for easy data processing
